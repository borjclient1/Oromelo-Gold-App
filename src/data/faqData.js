    question: "What's the difference between selling and pawning?",
    answer: "When you <strong>sell</strong> your gold items, you transfer ownership permanently in exchange for an agreed payment. With <strong>pawning</strong>, you use your item as collateral for a loan, and you can reclaim your item by repaying the loan with interest within the agreed timeframe."
